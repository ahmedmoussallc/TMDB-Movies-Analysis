We take an indepth look into the TMDB movies dataset.
Perform Data wrangling and cleaning
Explore the data
Ask some Questions such as:

1 - What is happening to the movie rating performance over the years?
2 - Is the movie business making more profit over the years or less?
3 - Are the number of movies increasing per year?
4 - What's the distribution of the movies runtime values?
5 - What's the relationship between budget spent on a movie and it's popularity?
6 - Finally, what's the relationship between budget spent and profit acquired?
